# Austin-Road-Analysis

For our first project in Data Science with Dr. Savala, my groupmates Luz Solorzano, Chloe Roque, and I analyzed Austinâ€™s road conditions using data from data.austintexas.gov. We worked with 4.1 million filtered rows of data collected from 2021-2024, uncovering key insights into why some areas in Austin experience worse road conditions than others.

Our project objectives included:

Exploring various factors affecting road conditions
Performing a detailed location-based analysis
Comparing areas to determine what influences better or worse conditions
